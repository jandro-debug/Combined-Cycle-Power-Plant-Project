# Combined-Cycle-Power-Plant-Project
Project to predict the electrical energy output of a combined cycle power plant given a set of 9568 hourly average ambient environmental readings from sensors at the power plant which we will use for our predictive analytics. This data can then be used to train AI models for future predictions.

This is a super straight forward excel project to use multiple linear regression models in predicitons. Make sure to have the add in for data analysis in excel. When you select the regression model you must use the residuals output to determine the predicted electrical output given the variables. This will allow you to make MAD, MSE, RMSE and MAPE calculations to validate your model.
